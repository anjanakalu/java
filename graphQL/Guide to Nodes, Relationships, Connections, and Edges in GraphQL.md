# graphql package
- It is the core GraphQL implementation in **JavaScript**.
- It provides the functionality to define GraphQL Schemas, parse and validate GraphQL queries, execute queries against a schema, and format responses.
- `graphql` is not tied to any specific server or client framework; it's a standalone library that can be used in various JavaScript environments.

# @apollo/server
- This package is part of the Apollo ecosystem and is used for building GraphQL servers in Node.js.
- It provides tools and utilities to create and manage GraphQL schemas, handle incoming GraphQL requests, execute queries, and send responses.
- `@apollo/server` is built on top of the popular Express framework, making it easy to integrate GraphQL into existing Node.js web applications.
- Overall, `@apollo/server` simplifies the process of creating and maintaining GraphQL servers in Node.js environments.

### **Comprehensive Guide to Nodes, Relationships, Connections, and Edges in GraphQL**

This guide provides a detailed explanation of how to model the provided dataset (`games`, `authors`, and `reviews`) using GraphQL's core concepts: **nodes**, **relationships**, **connections**, and **edges**. We'll explore how to structure the schema, traverse the graph, and perform mutations, with examples tailored to the dataset.

## **1. Nodes**

### **Definition**
Nodes are the fundamental units of data in a GraphQL schema. They represent entities or objects, such as `Game`, `Author`, and `Review`. Each node has fields that define its properties.

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Fields**: Nodes have fields that describe their attributes. For example:
  - A `Game` node has fields like `id`, `title`, and `platform`.
  - An `Author` node has fields like `id`, `name`, and `verified`.
  - A `Review` node has fields like `id`, `rating`, `content`, `author_id`, and `game_id`.
- **Unique Identification**: Each node is uniquely identified by an `ID` field, which is essential for fetching specific instances.

### **Example Schema**
```graphql
type Game {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  platform: [String!]!  # Array of platforms
}

type Author {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  verified: Boolean!
}

type Review {
  id: ID!
  rating: Int!
  content: String!
  author: Author!  # Relationship to Author
  game: Game!      # Relationship to Game
}
```

---

## **2. Relationships Between Nodes**

### **Definition**
Relationships define how nodes are connected to each other. In this dataset:
- A `Review` is linked to a `Game` via `game_id`.
- A `Review` is linked to an `Author` via `author_id`.

### **Types of Relationships**
1. **One-to-Many**:
   - A `Game` can have many `Review` nodes.
   - An `Author` can have many `Review` nodes.
2. **Many-to-One**:
   - A `Review` belongs to one `Game`.
   - A `Review` belongs to one `Author`.

### **Example Schema with Relationships**
```graphql
type Game {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  platform: [String!]!
  reviews: [Review!]!  # One-to-Many relationship with Review
}

type Author {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  verified: Boolean!
  reviews: [Review!]!  # One-to-Many relationship with Review
}

type Review {
  id: ID!
  rating: Int!
  content: String!
  author: Author!  # Many-to-One relationship with Author
  game: Game!      # Many-to-One relationship with Game
}
```

## **3. Connections and Edges**

### **Definition**
Connections and edges are used to represent relationships in a structured way, especially for pagination or complex data traversal.

### **Key Concepts**
- **Connections**: Represent the relationship between two types of nodes (e.g., `Game` and `Review`).
- **Edges**: Represent individual relationships within a connection. Each edge contains:
  - A `node` field: The actual entity being connected.
  - A `cursor` field: A unique identifier for pagination.

### **Example Schema with Connections and Edges**
```graphql
type Game {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  platform: [String!]!
  reviews: ReviewConnection!  # Connection to Review nodes
}

type ReviewConnection {
  edges: [ReviewEdge!]  # List of edges
  pageInfo: PageInfo!   # Pagination metadata
}

type ReviewEdge {
  node: Review!  # The actual Review node
  cursor: String!  # Cursor for pagination
}

type Review {
  id: ID!
  rating: Int!
  content: String!
  author: Author!  # Relationship to Author
  game: Game!      # Relationship to Game
}

type PageInfo {
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  hasPreviousPage: Boolean!
  startCursor: String
  endCursor: String
}
```

## **4. Traversing the Graph**

### **Queries**
GraphQL queries allow you to traverse the graph and retrieve data from related nodes. Here are some examples based on the dataset:

### **Example Query 1: Fetch a Game and Its Reviews**
```graphql
query {
  game(id: "1") {
    title
    platform
    reviews {
      edges {
        node {
          rating
          content
          author {
            name
            verified
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- This query fetches the `title`, `platform`, and `reviews` for a specific game, including the `rating`, `content`, and `author` details for each review.

### **Example Query 2: Fetch an Author and Their Reviews**
```graphql
query {
  author(id: "2") {
    name
    verified
    reviews {
      edges {
        node {
          rating
          content
          game {
            title
            platform
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- This query fetches the `name`, `verified` status, and `reviews` for a specific author, including the `rating`, `content`, and `game` details for each review.

### **Example Query 3: Fetch All Games with Paginated Reviews**
```graphql
query {
  games {
    id
    title
    platform
    reviews(first: 2) {  # Fetch first 2 reviews per game
      edges {
        node {
          rating
          content
          author {
            name
          }
        }
      }
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- This query fetches all games and their first 2 reviews, along with pagination information.

## **5. Mutations**

### **Definition**
Mutations allow you to modify data in the GraphQL schema. For example, you can create, update, or delete `Review` nodes.

### **Example Mutation 1: Create a Review**
```graphql
mutation {
  createReview(input: { gameId: "3", authorId: "1", rating: 8, content: "Amazing game!" }) {
    review {
      id
      rating
      content
      author {
        name
      }
      game {
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- This mutation creates a new `Review` node for a `Game` and returns the created review along with the associated `author` and `game` details.

### **Example Mutation 2: Update a Review**
```graphql
mutation {
  updateReview(id: "1", input: { rating: 10, content: "Updated review content" }) {
    review {
      id
      rating
      content
    }
  }
}
```
- This mutation updates the `rating` and `content` of a specific review.

### **Example Mutation 3: Delete a Review**
```graphql
mutation {
  deleteReview(id: "1") {
    success
    message
  }
}
```
- This mutation deletes a specific review and returns a success message.

---

## **6. Benefits of This Structure**

### **Flexibility**
- Clients can request exactly the data they need. For example, you can fetch a game's reviews without retrieving unnecessary fields.

### **Efficiency**
- Connections and edges enable efficient pagination and traversal of related data. For instance, you can fetch reviews in batches using pagination.

### **Consistency**
- The use of nodes and relationships ensures a consistent and predictable schema, making it easier to maintain and extend.

---

## **7. Real-World Example**

### **Query Example: Fetch a Game and Its First 3 Reviews**
```graphql
query {
  game(id: "2") {
    title
    platform
    reviews(first: 3) {  # Pagination: Fetch first 3 reviews
      edges {
        node {
          rating
          content
          author {
            name
            verified
          }
        }
      }
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- This query fetches the `title`, `platform`, and first 3 `reviews` for a specific game, along with pagination information.

---

## **8. Conclusion**

By modeling your data as **nodes**, defining **relationships**, and using **connections** and **edges**, you can build a flexible and efficient GraphQL API. This structure allows you to traverse and manipulate data in a structured and scalable way, making it ideal for applications like gaming platforms, blogging systems, or any other data-driven use case.

With the provided dataset, you can now design a GraphQL schema that effectively represents `games`, `authors`, and `reviews`, enabling powerful queries and mutations for your application. Whether you're building a simple API or a complex data-driven application, mastering these concepts is key to leveraging the full potential of GraphQL.
