Absolutely! Let's go deeper and build a **complete, detailed guide** on **GraphQL Fragments and Inline Fragments**, still keeping our **eCommerce products** scenario so it‚Äôs practical and relatable.

## üßæ GraphQL Fragments & Inline Fragments ‚Äì Detailed Guide (with eCommerce Example)

---

### üß© Part 1: GraphQL Fragments

---

### üîç What is a Fragment?

A **GraphQL Fragment** is a reusable set of fields that you can **share across multiple queries, mutations, or subscriptions**. It helps avoid repetition when the same fields are needed in different parts of your app.

---

### üõí eCommerce Scenario:

You‚Äôre working on an eCommerce app that shows products in:

- Product List Page
- Product Detail Page
- Shopping Cart
- Order Summary Page

Each of these needs product info like `id`, `name`, `price`, and `imageUrl`.

You could repeat the fields everywhere like this:

```graphql
products {
  id
  name
  price
  imageUrl
}
```

But that gets hard to maintain, especially if you later add fields like `currency` or `discount`.

---

### ‚úÖ Fragment to the Rescue

#### üéØ Step 1: Create a Fragment

```graphql
fragment ProductBasicInfo on Product {
  id
  name
  price
  imageUrl
}
```

#### ‚úÖ Step 2: Use the Fragment in Queries

```graphql
query GetAllProducts {
  products {
    ...ProductBasicInfo
  }
}
```

You can now reuse `ProductBasicInfo` in other queries too ‚Äî for cart, orders, wishlist, etc.

---

### üí° When to Use Fragments?

- When multiple components need the same fields.
- When you want to centralize field definitions (easy to update in one place).
- When your UI is modular ‚Äî like `ProductCard`, `ProductTile`, `ProductRow`.

---

### üëÄ Example: Multiple Uses

```graphql
query ProductList {
  products {
    ...ProductBasicInfo
  }
}

query CartItems {
  cart {
    items {
      ...ProductBasicInfo
      quantity
    }
  }
}
```

---

## üß© Part 2: Inline Fragments

---

### üîç What is an Inline Fragment?

Inline fragments are used **within queries** to access fields **conditionally**, based on the **concrete type** of an object.

Useful when you're working with:

- **Union types** (e.g., `SearchResult = Product | Category | Brand`)
- **Interfaces** (e.g., `Product = PhysicalProduct | DigitalProduct | SubscriptionProduct`)

---

### üõçÔ∏è eCommerce Example: Product Types

Your `Product` type can return **multiple subtypes**:

- `PhysicalProduct`: `weight`, `shippingDetails`
- `DigitalProduct`: `downloadUrl`
- `SubscriptionProduct`: `billingCycle`, `trialPeriod`

GraphQL doesn't know in advance which one you're dealing with, so you **must use inline fragments**.

---

### ‚úÖ Inline Fragment Example:

```graphql
query GetProductDetails {
  products {
    id
    name
    price
    ... on PhysicalProduct {
      weight
      shippingDetails
    }
    ... on DigitalProduct {
      downloadUrl
    }
    ... on SubscriptionProduct {
      billingCycle
      trialPeriod
    }
  }
}
```

This tells GraphQL:
> ‚ÄúIf this item is of type `PhysicalProduct`, give me `weight` and `shippingDetails`; if it‚Äôs `DigitalProduct`, give me `downloadUrl`, and so on.‚Äù

---

### üí° When are Inline Fragments Required?

- When querying **fields specific to a subtype**.
- When a field returns **a union or interface**.
- When using CMSes like Prismic, Sanity, or Contentful, which often use polymorphic slice types.

### üß† Differences: Fragment vs Inline Fragment

| Feature               | Fragment                           | Inline Fragment                              |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Purpose                | Reuse common fields                | Handle different types (union/interface)       |
| Use in unions/interfaces | ‚ùå Not enough                     | ‚úÖ Required                                     |
| Reusability           | ‚úÖ Can be reused across queries     | ‚ùå Only used inline in one place               |
| Syntax                | `fragment ... on Type`             | `... on SubType { fields }`                   |
| Example               | `ProductCardInfo`                  | `... on DigitalProduct { downloadUrl }`       |

---

## üîß Bonus: Combining Both

You can **combine fragments with inline fragments** for clean and type-safe queries.

```graphql
fragment ProductCommonFields on Product {
  id
  name
  price
  ... on PhysicalProduct {
    weight
  }
  ... on DigitalProduct {
    downloadUrl
  }
}

query GetProducts {
  products {
    ...ProductCommonFields
  }
}
```

## üìå Summary

| Concept         | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fragment**    | Reusable field sets for a specific type.                                    |
| **Inline Fragment** | Used to query fields of specific subtypes within union/interface types.   |
| **Use Fragment**     | When fields are reused across multiple places.                          |
| **Use Inline Fragment** | When querying type-specific fields from unions/interfaces.               |
| **eCommerce Use Cases** | Product cards, cart items, search results, polymorphic product types. |
